# Housing Price Prediction Model

This project is focused on building a model to predict housing prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, etc. The model is developed using Python and machine learning techniques. The ultimate goal is to deploy this model in a web application using Python Flask, allowing users to input data and receive predictions on housing prices.

## Introduction

Housing prices are influenced by a variety of factors including location, size, amenities, and market trends. Accurately predicting housing prices can be beneficial for both buyers and sellers. This project aims to develop a robust predictive model that can be easily used via a web interface.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Predictive capabilities for new data inputs.
- User-friendly web interface to input data and get predictions.
- Visualization of data trends and prediction confidence.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language used for development.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for model building.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Flask**: Web framework for deploying the model as a web application.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Virtual environment (recommended).

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/housing-price-prediction.git
   cd housing-price-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data and model:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook HousingPricePredictionModel.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

### Model Training

1. Ensure that you have all the necessary data files in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.

### Web Application (Coming Soon)

- The Flask web application will be developed to provide a user interface for inputting data and receiving predictions.
- Users will be able to upload datasets, input features manually, and view predictions.
